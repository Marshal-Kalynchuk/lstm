# LSTM Crypto Prediction Project

This project is an exploration into using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for predicting cryptocurrency prices, specifically focusing on the SOL/USD currency pair. Despite not achieving accurate predictions, it was a valuable learning experience in machine learning and LSTM models.

Key Features:
- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy, including scaling and creating rolling windows for LSTM input.
- Building and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras, with layers like CuDNNLSTM and Dropout.
- Generating data for training and testing the LSTM model.
- Visualization of the model's predictions compared to actual data using Seaborn.

The project highlights the challenges of predicting volatile cryptocurrency markets and the complexities involved in training LSTM networks. It serves as a testament to the learning process in machine learning, particularly in time series forecasting.
